 * types for AC_ALPHABET_t will lead to a better performance. so instead of
 * dealing with strings of chars, we assume dealing with strings of
 * AC_ALPHABET_t and leave it optional for other developers to define their

 * of output. furthermore, sometimes it is useful, for example while
 * retrieving patterns from a database, to maintain their identifiers in the
 * automata for further reference. we provisioned two possible types as a
 * union for this purpose. you can add your desired type in it.

 * This is the pattern type that must be fed into AC automata.
 * the 'astring' field is not null-terminated, due to it can contain zero
 * value bytes. the 'length' field determines the number of AC_ALPHABET_t it
 * carries. the 'representative' field is described in AC_REP_t. despite
 * 'astring', 'representative' can have duplicate values for different given
 * AC_PATTERN_t. it is an optional field and you can just fill it with 0.
 * CAUTION:
 * Not always the 'astring' points to the correct position in memory.
 * it is the responsibility of your program to maintain a permanent allocation
 * for astring field of the added pattern to automata.

 * Provides the structure for reporting a match event.
 * a match event occurs when the automata reaches a final node. any final
 * node can match one or more pattern at a position in a text. the
 * 'patterns' field holds these matched patterns. obviously these
 * matched patterns have same end-position in the text. there is a relationship
 * between matched patterns: the shorter one is a factor (tail) of the longer
 * one. the 'position' maintains the end position of matched patterns. the
 * start position of patterns could be found by knowing their 'length' in
 * AC_PATTERN_t. e.g. suppose "recent" and "cent" are matched at
 * position 40 in the text, then the start position of them are 34 and 36
 * respectively. finally the field 'match_num' maintains the number of
 * matched patterns.
