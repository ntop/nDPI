Tor
---

Tor protocol can use SSL to hide itself. These are examples:

TCP 37.128.208.46:9001 <-> 172.16.253.130:2078 [VLAN: 0][proto: 91/SSL][132 pkts/93834 bytes][SSL client: www.jwrpsthzrih.com]
TCP 172.16.253.130:2021 <-> 75.147.140.249:443 [VLAN: 0][proto: 91/SSL][28 pkts/8053 bytes][SSL client: www.5akw23dx.com]
TCP 172.16.253.130:2077 <-> 77.247.181.163:443 [VLAN: 0][proto: 91/SSL][136 pkts/94329 bytes][SSL client: www.fk4pprq42hsvl2wey.com]

It can be detected by analyzing the SSL client certificate and checking the name that does not match to a real host in
addition of begin a bit weird. As doing DNS resolution is not a task for nDPI we let applications do and then recognize
SSL-tunnelled connections.

For this reason nDPI uses a heuristic, non-DNS based, approach to detect tor communications. If possible, apps
should validate the certificate using the DNS. This is not something nDPI can afford to do for performance
reasons
