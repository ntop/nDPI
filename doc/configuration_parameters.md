| Protocol     | Parameter                                 | Default value | Min value | Max value | Description | Notes  |
| ------       | ------                                    | ------        | ------    | ------    | ------      | ------ |
| NULL         | "packets_limit_per_flow"                  | 32            | 0         | 255       | The upper limit on the number of packets per flow that will be subject to DPI, after which classification will be considered complete (0 = no limit) |
| NULL         | "flow.direction_detection"                | enable        | NULL      | NULL      | Enable/disable internal detection of packet direction (client to server or server to client) |
| NULL         | "flow.track_payload"                      | disable       | NULL      | NULL      | Enable/disable tracking/export of flow payload (i.e. L5/7 data): if enabled, the library exports the first 1024 bytes of payload for each flow  |
| NULL         | "tcp_ack_payload_heuristic"               | disable       | NULL      | NULL      | In some networks, there are some anomalous TCP flows where the smallest ACK packets have some kind of zero padding. It looks like the IP and TCP headers in those frames wrongly consider the 0x00 Ethernet padding bytes as part of the TCP payload. While this kind of packets is perfectly valid per-se, in some conditions they might be treated by the TCP reassembler logic as (partial) overlaps, deceiving the classification engine. This parameter enable/disable an heuristic to detect these packets and to ignore them, allowing correct detection/classification. See #1946 for other details |
| NULL         | "fully_encrypted_heuristic"               | enable        | NULL      | NULL      | Enable/disable an heuristic to detect fully encrypted sessions, i.e. flows where every bytes of the payload is encrypted in an attempt to “look like nothing”. This heuristic only analyzes the first packet of the flow. See: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec23fall-prepub-234-wu-mingshi.pdf |
| NULL         | "libgcrypt.init"                          | 1             | NULL      | NULL      | Enable/disable initialization of libgcrypt. When using the external libgcrypt (instead of the internal crypto code) the libgcrypt runtime must be initialized. If, for whatever reasons, the application alread does it, nDPI must be told to skip it. Note that, by default, nDPI uses the crypto code and not libgcrypt: in that case this parameter is ignored |

By default, DNS flows are fully classified after the first request/response pair (or after the first response, if the request is missing). If this parameter is disabled, the flows are fully classified after the first packet, i.e. usually after the first request; in that case, some flow risks are not checked and some metadata are not exported |

Useful for proper (sub)classification when the beginning of the flows are not captured or if there are lost packets in the the captured traffic. If enabled, nDPI requires more packets to process for each RTP/RTCP flow. |

Note that an OpenVPN message may be splitted into multiple (TCP/UDP) packets and that a (TCP/UDP) packet may contains multiple OpenVPN messages. Higher the value, lower the false positive rate but more packets are required by nDPI for processing. |
